Node.js REPL Terminal.

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell 
where a command is entered and the system responds with an output in an interactive mode. 

Node.js or Node comes bundled with a REPL environment. It performs the following tasks;

Read - Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.

Eval - Takes and evaluates the data structure.

Print - Prints the result.

Loop - Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice.

The REPL feature of Node is very useful in experimenting with Node.js codes and to debug JavaScript codes.
